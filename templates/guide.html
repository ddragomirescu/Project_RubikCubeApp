            <h2>Beginner's Guide</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the beginner's guide for solving the Rubik's Cube! This guide will walk you through
                the fundamental concepts and steps needed to solve a standard 3x3 Rubik's Cube. Whether you're
                a complete beginner or looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide will help you understand
                the basic principles of cube solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we begin, familiarize yourself with the basic notation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R</strong> - Right face clockwise</li>
                <li><strong>L</strong> - Left face clockwise</li>
                <li><strong>U</strong> - Upper face clockwise</li>
                <li><strong>D</strong> - Down face clockwise</li>
                <li><strong>F</strong> - Front face clockwise</li>
                <li><strong>B</strong> - Back face clockwise</li>
                <li><strong>R'</strong> - Right face counter-clockwise (and similarly for others)</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Step 1: White Cross</h3>
                <p>
                    The first step in solving the Rubik's Cube is to create a white cross on one face.
                    This involves positioning the four white edge pieces around the white center piece.

                <h3>Step 2: White Corners</h3>
                <p>
                    After completing the white cross, the next step is to solve the white corners.
                    This means placing all four white corner pieces in their correct positions.

                <h3>Step 3: Middle Layer Edges</h3>
                <p>
                    With the first layer complete, we now focus on solving the middle layer edges.
                    This step involves positioning the four edge pieces that belong in the middle layer.

                <h3>Step 4: Yellow Cross</h3>
                <p>
                    The fourth step is creating a yellow cross on the top face. This is similar to
                    the white cross we made in Step 1, but now on the opposite side.

                <h3>Step 5: Yellow Edges</h3>
                <p>
                    After forming the yellow cross, we need to position the yellow edge pieces correctly.
                    This ensures that the edge pieces match with the center pieces on the adjacent faces.

                <h3>Step 6: Yellow Corners Position</h3>
                <p>
                    In this step, we position the yellow corner pieces in their correct locations,
                    although they may not be oriented correctly yet.

                <h3>Step 7: Yellow Corners Orientation</h3>
                <p>
                    The final step! We orient the yellow corner pieces correctly to complete the cube.
                    After this step, your Rubik's Cube should be fully solved!
